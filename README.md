# Getting Started with the app

while in the root directory, type `yarn install` first to install all the node_modules require for the app 

After all packages have been installed. Run the application by typing `yarn start` then it will 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Technical issue:
I notice that when logged in with username `Bret` the app is loading photos and details completely. I haven't got time to 
troubshoot properly.
